            "comment": "Services were great but I'm single so $60 per week for 3 meals for 2 people is a lot. Good portion sizes but I like variety so I don't want to eat the same thing for a couple of meals. If there was an option for one person portions at a reasonable price, I could see my ordering a 4 or 5 day meal plan. Lunch/dinner would be one less thing to have to worry about during the week.",

I received an sms at 1.16pm to let me know that my box had been delivered - however until now 8.05pm, I have received nothing! I tried to respond to your text from 0414414446 indicating that I had not received my delivery and also rang your contact number which is unattended - due to it being the weekend.  I have to say that this is really frustrating! Not only was I looking forward to trying your product, but I have now wasted a whole day waiting. I'm not sure if this is a common problem, but I think that I won't be using your service if fresh products don't show up when they're meant to!",
